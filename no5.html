                <strong>
                    <u>Fox is a common name for many species of carnivorous mammals belonging to the Canidae family.</u>
                </strong> Foxes are small to medium-sized canids (slightly smaller than the medium-sized domestic dog), characterized by possessing a long narrow snout, and a bushly tail (or brush). <br><br>
                <strong> <u> Members of about 37 spices are referred to as foxes, of which only 12 species have been extensively studied and characterized by scientists.<br>
                    These fox species exhibit a wide range of adaptations to their diverse habitats, showcasing their remarkable ability to thrive in various environments around the world. From the swift and agile swift fox to the elusive arctic fox with its thick fur, each of these 12 species has evolved unique traits that make them fascinating subjects of ecological research and conservation efforts.</u></strong>
